===Change Log===
1.1.1
- IMPORTANT: I've split out Settings from the 001_Script file. They are now in their own 000_Settings file. Please add all of your settings in that file, instead.
- Made a change that will hopefully prevent a nil.id crash.

1.1 
- Reworked how you add x and y adjustments in the Comment command. Instructions have been updated in 001_Script.
- New feature: X and y adjustments for definitions. Added x_adjustment and y_adjustment as optional parameters for EVENT_INDICATORS definitions. As a result, there are now 3 ways you can adjust the x and y positions of indicators: globally, per definition, and per event.

1.0 
- Initial Release
